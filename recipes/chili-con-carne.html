        <h1>Chili Con Carne</h1>
        <img src="../images/chili.jpg"

        <p>This great chilli recipe has to be one of the best dishes to serve to 
            friends for a casual get-together. An easy sharing favourite that uses up 
            storecupboard ingredients.</p>
            <p>This is another personal faourite that is a staple in my kitchen and does
                not take long to cook at all. A flavourful Mexican classic.</p>
