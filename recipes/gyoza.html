        <p>Juicy on the inside, crispy and golden brown on the outside, 
            these Japanese pan-fried dumplings, or Gyoza, are a popular weeknight 
            meal as well as a great appetizer for your next dinner party.</p>
        <p>Gyoza (餃子), or Japanese pan-fried dumplings, are as ubiquitous as ramen in Japan. 
            You can find these mouthwatering dumplings being served at specialty shops, izakaya, 
            ramen shops, grocery stores or even at festivals.</p>

                <li>1 tsp roasted sesame oil</li>

                <li>1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>

                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp Japanese chili oil</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all the ingredients. <strong>Tip:</strong> After you open the gyoza wrappers, 
                    make sure to cover them under a damp towel or plastic wrap so they 
                    don't dry out.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>To make Gyoza Filling</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Optional step:</strong> As cabbage leaves are thick and hard, 
                    we use different ways to wilt them. You can blanch or microwave the l
                    eaves for a minute or two. You can also sprinkle them with salt to 
                    dehydrate the cabbage, then squeeze the water out. Or you can skip the 
                    entire process altogether.
                </li>
                <li>Discard the thick core of the cabbage leaves; mince the leaves into very 
                    small pieces.
                </li>
                <li>Mince the green onions and shiitake mushrooms into small pieces.</li>
                <li>Combine the ground meat, cabbage, green onions, and shiitake 
                    mushrooms in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the seasonings to the bowl.</li>
                <li>Mix well and knead the mixture with your hand until it becomes 
                    pale in color and sticky.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>To fold the Gyoza</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fold the wrapper in half over the filling and pinch it in the 
                    center with your fingers, but don’t seal it yet.</li>
                <li>Using the thumb and index finger of your right hand, 
                    start making a pleat about once every ¼ inch (6 mm) on the top part of the 
                    wrapper from the center toward the right side, making 3-4 pleats. 
                    <strong>Tip:</strong> As you fold each pleat, press the folded pleat 
                    tightly against the back part of the wrapper using your left thumb and 
                    index finger.</li>
                    <li>Continue with the left side of the gyoza, making 3-4 pleats with your 
                        left hand, starting in the center and moving toward the left side.</Li>
                    <li>Press the pleats and shape the gyoza. Repeat folding the remaining wrappers.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>To store (if you don't cook all of them)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Before the filling starts to release moisture and make the wrappers soggy, 
                    cover the gyoza with plastic wrap and <strong>“flash freeze”</strong> them 
                    in the freezer until solid (or at least frozen on the outside). 
                    Make sure to lay out the gyoza in a single layer on a sheet pan or plate. 
                    Once the gyoza are solid, pack them in an airtight bag. 
                    Because you flash froze them, the gyoza won’t stick to each other in the bag. 
                    You can store the gyoza in the freezer for up to a month. When you’re 
                    ready to use the gyoza, do not defrost them. Place the frozen 
                    gyoza in your frying pan and steam them for an extra 1-2 minutes.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>To cook the Gyoza</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. 
                    When the pan is hot, place the gyoza in a single layer, 
                    flat side down in a circular pattern (or place them in two columns).
                </li>
                <li>Cook until the bottom of the gyoza turns golden brown, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add ¼ cup of water to the pan. Immediately cover with a lid and steam the 
                    gyoza for about 3 minutes or until most of the water evaporates.</li>
                <li>Remove the lid to evaporate any remaining water. Drizzle 1 tsp 
                    sesame oil around the gyoza in the frying pan.</li>
                <li>Cook uncovered until the gyoza is golden brown and crisp on the bottom. </li>
                <li>Transfer to a plate and serve with the dipping sauce. For the dipping sauce, 
                    combine the sauce ingredients in a small plate and mix together. </li>
            </ol>
